% Description: Linear Vertical Mixing model to simuluate observations made from drill cuttings.
% Author: Christine Regalla
% Written: August 2024
% Code based on a vertical mixing model produced by IODP Exp 338 shipboard
% scientists. Plots are based on those in IODP Exp 338, 348 and 358
% reports. http://iodp.tamu.edu/publications/PR.html
%
%
% This mixing model assumes that cuttings are mixed over a 20m interval, 
% with a linear decay of contributions of cuttings with distance uphole, 
% within that interval, from 100% at the base of the interval to 0% at the 
% top of the interval. 
%
% The mixing model is mathematically defined by the equation:
%   the integral (âˆ«) from (x-v) to x of mx*dx = 1. 
%   where x = downhole depth, v = the vertical mixing interval and m= the linear mixing gradient.

% Model B - Simulate fault zones of various thickness, and various fault rock density. 
%           In this model, Fault zones are marked by the presence of cuttings with scaley fabric

%           from a fault zone necessarily will contain fault rocks, this model includes 
%           both fault zones where 100% of the cuttings have scaley fabric (which
